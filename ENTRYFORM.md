You can find a very good reference to Github flavoured markdown reference in [this cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet). If you want something a bit more WYSIWYG for editing then could use [StackEdit](https://stackedit.io/app) which provides a more user friendly interface for generating the Markdown code. Those of you who are [VS Code fans](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/markdown#_markdown-preview) can edit/preview directly in that interface too.

## Comments
The purpose of the module was to enhance SXA by the count down timer in order to get a new SXA module that can be used anywhere. Seen the countdown timer in a lot of web pages. The idea was to create a template and in that template fill it in with Date, and the text for dyas, years, and months. This also works for sales that have an expiration and then get the price expiration date and see the time that it will expire.
