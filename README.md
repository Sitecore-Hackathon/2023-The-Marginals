You can find a very good reference to Github flavoured markdown reference in [this cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet). If you want something a bit more WYSIWYG for editing then could use [StackEdit](https://stackedit.io/app) which provides a more user friendly interface for generating the Markdown code. Those of you who are [VS Code fans](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/markdown#_markdown-preview) can edit/preview directly in that interface too.

## Team name
⟹ The Marginals

## Category
⟹ SXA Headless Enhancement

## Description
⟹ Adding a countdown timer to SXA Headless Module.   

  - Module Purpose:
 The SXA Headless Countdown Timer module is a custom module built for Sitecore Experience Accelerator (SXA) that provides a configurable countdown timer component that can be added to any page. The module allows content editors to specify the target date and time, and the component will display the remaining time in days, hours, minutes, and seconds until that date is reached. The module is built with extensibility in mind, allowing developers to customize the look and feel of the component, and integrate it with other systems or components as needed. The module can be used to create a sense of urgency or anticipation on pages, and can be easily configured to suit the needs of different sites or campaigns.

As soon as you add the component you the idea was to change it with some properties. the properties will change its color, font size and font color. With that it makes it highly customazible. 


The idea was to see the following image on the countdown timer:

## Comments
In conclusion, the main objective of the module was to add a countdown timer to Sitecore Experience Accelerator (SXA) in order to provide a new SXA module that can be used on any page. The countdown timer component is a commonly seen feature on many websites, and can be used to create a sense of urgency or anticipation on pages. The module was designed to provide a customizable countdown timer component that can be easily configured to suit the needs of different sites or campaigns. The component is built with a template that allows content editors to fill in the target date and time, and the text for days, years, and months. This functionality can also be used for sales that have an expiration, by specifying the price expiration date and seeing the time remaining until it expires. Overall, the module enhances the capabilities of SXA and provides an intuitive way to add a countdown timer component to any page.
